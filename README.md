Codes were used to generate the examples in Rees, Dollar and Wathen, 
[Optimal solvers for PDE-Constrained Optimization](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/080727154),
SIAM J. Sci. Comput., Vol. 32, pp. 271-298, 2010, and my 
[DPhil thesis](http://www.numerical.rl.ac.uk/people/rees/pdf/TRThesis.pdf) (Oxford, 2010).

## Instructions
Run via the file setup.m

Default parameters for the problem setup are picked in set_def_setup.m
These can be changed to the values given in the file comments.

Default parameters for the solution method are picked in set_def_soln.m
The main ones you'll edit are also repeated in setup.m, with options
commented alongside them
